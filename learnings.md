## flex-direction
Flex box has concept of axis, There is a main axis and a cross axis( which is 
perpendicular to main axis)
1. row - For row main axis runs from left to right and cross axis runs from top to bottom 
2. column - For column main axis runs from top to bottom and cross axis runs from left to right 
3. row-reverse - Main axis runs from right to left and cross, top  to bottom
4. column-reverse - Main axis runs from bottom to top and cross left to right

## flex-wrap
1. no wrap - default, all elements stay on the same row
2. wrap - Elements are wrapped onto new line 
3. wrap-reverse - reverses the cross axis of elements from top-bottom to bottom-top, doesn't affect the flex-direction
